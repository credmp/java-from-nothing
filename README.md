Java From Nothing
=================

This project is the sample code of a series of blogposts at
[Credmp.org](http://www.credmp.org).

Structure
-----------------

The series of blogposts goes from absolutely nothing to a full fledge
application. The source tree has branches for single post so that the
follower at home can easily see the code for that post.

The syntax is as follows: <number of the blogpost>_<main topic>. So
the first branch is called *01_getting_started*.
